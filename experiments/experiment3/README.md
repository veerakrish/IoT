# Experiment 3: WiFi in IoT Systems

## Objective
Demonstrate the use of WiFi in IoT systems using ESP32 to create a simple web server.

## Components Required
1. ESP32 Dev Kit V1
2. WiFi Network (2.4GHz)
3. Jumper Wires (if connecting additional sensors)

## Setup Instructions
1. Update the WiFi credentials in the code (SSID and password)
2. Upload the code to ESP32
3. Open Serial Monitor to view the ESP32's IP address
4. Connect a device to the same WiFi network
5. Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address shown in Serial Monitor

## Expected Output
A web interface showing sensor data (if connected) and system status.

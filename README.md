# IoT Lab

Welcome to the IoT Lab repository! This repository contains a collection of hands-on experiments and projects focused on Internet of Things (IoT) development.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
   - ESP32 or compatible development board
   - Required libraries (specified in each experiment)

2. **Repository Structure**
   ```

   ```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veerakrish/IoT.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired experiment directory:
   ```bash
   cd IoT/experiments/experiment1
   ```

3. Open the `.ino` file in your Arduino IDE or PlatformIO

4. Install any required libraries (check the experiment's README)

5. Upload the code to your board
